This is [Film Storyboards](https://film-storyboards.com) 2020 portfolio site, build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) + [TACHYONS](http://tachyons.io), and [alternate](https://github.com/YJPL/alternate) theme.

# Get Started + Development

```
git clone git://github.com/YJPL/film-storyboards.git
cd film-storyboards
(npm install tachyons)
npm start
```
That should do the trick.
Then open another tab in terminal and run

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

This will build the site.

This sets up a Jekyll server for dev on port 4000. The site is regenerated every time you save a file.
NOTE: Changing ```_config.yml``` will require a restart of the Jekyll server to see changes.

To restart server, go to terminal tab that server is running in then press

`ctrl+C â‡§  enter`
then you can use custom Gulp.js commands (make sure to install gulp 4):

`gulp build`

This runs a series of tasks: minifies CSS, images and Javascript.


To fire Jekyll with auto-regeneration, use:

`gulp watch`

This command builds the site locally on port 3000, with [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) so you can quickly revise design changes.
