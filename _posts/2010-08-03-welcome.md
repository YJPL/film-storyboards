Welcome to this new site showcasing cinematic pre-production works.

[Film Storyboards](https://film-storyboards.com/) provides with production design and visual storytelling services for films, animation, and cross-media projects. I draw visuals for feature films, animation, advertising, games, live shows, events, theme parks, music videos, theatre, and museums.

I like sequential illustration and storyboarding represents a considerable part of my experience as an [illustrator](https://alternatyves.com/). I started out working as a commercial storyboard artist in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 1999.

From Saigon, I drew storyboards for Southeast Asia’s fast-growing advertising and film scenes for the next two years. Since then, moving on, continued working as a freelancer for clients in Europe and globally.

Today, storyboarding amounts to about 1/3 of my practice, alongside illustration and art direction.

Currently based in Brussels, I travel to draw on location or work from my studio. Helping production houses, advertising agencies, animation companies, and award-winning directors visualize, present and pitch their projects.

For example, a shooting storyboards can be helpful for a production to estimate the budget for special effects, that will inform VFX and SFX work and help the crew prepare and communicate complex action scenes. Storyboards sometimes involve conceptual illustrations and set design. A storyboard can also be a form of script development, an editing tool, and even a marketing tool.

If you are looking for a story artist for a film production, check [samples of my work in different styles](https://film-storyboards.com/category/portfolio/). For credentials, visit the credits page to make sure your projects will be in good hands,

This site will host my [portfolio](https://film-storyboards.com/category/portfolio/), colour and black and white storyboards samples along with some notes about the works, preparatory drawings, roughs sketches etc.

In time, the site will also host [storyboard templates](https://film-storyboards.com/storyboards-templates/), articles, and [resources](https://film-storyboards.com/resources/) about storyboarding. If you are looking for a layout template for a specific screen ratio that you don’t see on that page, you will more likely find it in the [templates shop](https://gumroad.com/storyboards/).

This site is an ongoing project, wedding the forgotten art of old-school storyboarding with contemporary digital illustration. Watch this space if you love storytelling for film, multimedia and concept art.
