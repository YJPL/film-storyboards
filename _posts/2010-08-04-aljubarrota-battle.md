Storyboard and production drawings for a film projection on large screen (ratio 3/1) for <a href="http://www.fundacao-aljubarrota.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fundação Batalha de Aljubarrota</em></a> (FBA), the Aljubarrota Battle Interpretation Centre (<a href="http://maps.google.pt/maps/place?cid=12115055260126942618&amp;q=centro+de+interpreta%3F%3Fo+da+Batalha+de+Aljubarrota&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ved=0CFsQ-gswAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VsdkToC4M42nOsbcnKkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIBA</a>) in Portugal.

  The result of extended teamwork with producer &amp; content designer Johan Schelfhout, Maverick ICS, this storyboard was initially used as a visual screenplay to pitch the show to <em>Fundação Batalha de Aljubarrota</em> but also proved a very good tool to help write the adaptation itself in sequences.

  Production Companies:

  <a href="http://www.maverick-ics.be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Maverick ICS</em></a>
  <a href="http://www.grid-vfx.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Grid VFX</em></a>
  <em><a href="http://www.filmesdotejo.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filmes do Tejo</a> </em>

The script is an adaptation of <em>Fernão Lopes</em> chronicles, depicting the 1383-1385 Portuguese crisis known as <em>Interregno</em>. A story for the modern viewer, seen through the lenses of an almost contemporary witness,  revisited by todays scholars to be as historically accurate as possible.  The fierce political fights for power over the kingdom followed the death of the King Fernando I, and a civil war ensued culminating with the Aljubarrota battle in 1385, which involved Portuguese troops and English longbowmen allies fighting against Castilian and French knights. In this early version, the audience follows <em>Fernão Lopes</em> as the narrator on the battlefield in the the battle aftermath and is told how it came to be, from court intrigues, murders and alliances to medieval warfare and military tactics.

As for the storyboards, we did many more for this adaptation, since there were adjustments made to the film, including re-shooting of a few scenes with additional budget.

Interior scenes were filmed with more people or in different locations than initially.

Even though we had a few film references, a big part of these scene actually work more like theatre.

In the end the show focus shifted towards a little bit more of spectacle and the battle itself. [Another series of storyboards](/animatics/ "Animatics – Aljubarotta Battle") reflect that.
