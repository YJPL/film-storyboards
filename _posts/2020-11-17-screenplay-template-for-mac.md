Formatting your screenplay doesn't have to be tedious.
You can use this free template designed to help you write in screenplay form (Warner Brothers format) with [Apple Pages](https://www.apple.com/pages/){: .b .blue .hover-gray}, an app from the free Apple productivity suite.

The title page is pretty much self-explanatory: you can write your title, credit, and add your contact details.
Then, start writing your screenplay using the **Text** tab to format your script:

- SCENE HEADING

- Action

- CHARACTER CUE

- Dialogue

- Parenthetical

- TRANSITION

- SHOT

- General

The scene index will build up as you fill your script with scenes.

The template uses Courier, the traditional screenplay font, but if you want it to look better, you should use ***Courier Prime***, an open-source font designed by *[Alan Dague-Greene](http://basicrecipe.com/)* for John August and Quote-Unquote Apps — you can download it here: [https://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime](https://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime).

You can also get the [Apple Pages template for Screenplay (Cole and Haag model)](https://gum.co/Cole-Haag-screenplay).
The **Cole & Haag** format is a less used screenplay format based on *Standard Screenplay Formats*, a book by Cole and Haag.
