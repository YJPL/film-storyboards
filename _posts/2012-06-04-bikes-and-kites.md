Directed by [Marc R. Wilkins](http://marcwilkins.com/). Produced by [Lovo Films](http://www.lovo.be/) Brussels. Client: non-profit recycling organization Fost Plus 2008 awareness campaign.


The roughs for the two films show my usual storyboarding process — a very simple one: drafting the whole camera angles and compositions in very tiny frames, on the fly, during live discussion with the director or over the phone — these where done over the phone and the help of very precise visual and written notes, so you'll notice very little difference with the final boards.

In this case a double page holds an overview of each 30 seconds film but there are instances where you would need an entire sketchbook for a single story.
