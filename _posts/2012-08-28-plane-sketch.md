Plane sketch &ndash; Drawn while flying from Gosselie to Bucharest

Since I got my first pencils, I kept drawing everywhere. Looking back, some of my best sketches came from drawing in public transportation. &nbsp;In planes, trains, trams, in the subway&mldr;

**Being in motion itself*** is what seems to keep drawings and ideas flowing.

* instead of Travelling.&nbsp;

As some of the best thinking comes out of uneventful walks, most of my best drawing are commute** sketches. So why are they better? For one, they are not overworked, they look effortless. This is not to say all the best work comes from travels. But at the very least, you can trace some of my best works back from ideas, notes and sketches done during travels.

**instead of travel

I&#8217;m not making the case for a Peripatetic school of drawing here. Drawing while walking is uneasy!

**But being in motion in itself** helps unlock the drawing flow. Or the writing or thinking flow, for that matter, as these are in essence the same thing.

Even if you are not drawing, no matter what you do, that is a very good reason to carry a sketchbook at all times. And if you are drawing, you should read or re-read the [The Draughtsman&rsquo;s Sketchbook Creed](https://j.mp/draughtsman-doctrine).

Car and coaches don&rsquo;t work for me, but a boat is a fantastic place for drawing, most of the time. And I bet Zeppelin would be perfect.&nbsp;

This is how I picture my ideal office:

I would love an office going in smooth motion through air, sea and land; some kind of an itinerant workshop.&nbsp;

## A convertible an transportable office

## Flying for clients

Working while travelling all the time would be ideal. To do that you would have to either build a special flying office or have clients flying you for work each time. Flying works wonder, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the results would be worth the cost.

But let&rsquo;s face it: nowadays, clients, even big ones tend to avoid sending people on locations when they can. Remote work works. &nbsp;Video conference and emails are efficient replacement for travel most of the time.

// Insert virtue of people working together & meeting physically in the same place. //

That&rsquo;s ok too, cutting costs is the rational thing to do.

It makes sense to watch your spendings in this economy. Countless meetings were a waste of time and jet fuel money. Good grief if remote work replaced those. Until fast long distance travels becomes sustainable, companies and individuals should reduce flying. Take a plane only when it is indispensable.

But in the long run cutting cost sometimes means missing out on some great ideas.

Companies, including outside of the creative industries, should reconsider their travel budget. If only to see how it impacts their innovation threshold. And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a huge budget. Employees and collaborators could go out for long walks more often. Run together. Hold your next meeting in a train. In any case, allocating funds to make people move more is money well spend. &nbsp;

Repurpose Commuting

Gamify your commute to work!

As a creative individual, as a company, as a client, you know what you need to do. One needs not to go very far to unlock to marvels of creative flow.
