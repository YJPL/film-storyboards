## If you prefer en franÃ§ais ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·

![ScÃ©narimages](/images/uploads/2023/04/Scenarimage_20230412.png)

So, I've relaunched [ScÃ©narimages](https://film-storyboards.fr), the French version of the site, for those who prefer to read *en franÃ§ais*.

The site follows the same structure as the English site, but most of its content is different since it pertains to French films and publicitÃ©s.

There is also a new section on [drawings](https://film-storyboards.fr/dessins/).

The site, built with Jekyll, is open source and available on GitHub. You are welcome to contribute to improving this theme here: [https://github.com/YJPL/scenarimages](https://github.com/YJPL/scenarimages).
