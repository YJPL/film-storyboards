Animatics — illustrations series made for audio guides depicting the 1385 Aljubarrota battle.

The sequences take the visitor through different phases of the famous Portuguese defensive battle, one of the first of its kind in Europe, exploring the trenching tactic used, troops movements and other historical aspects while interactive features draw on some of the injuries inflicted on soldiers whose remains were later found on the battlefield, studied by archeologists and visible in the interpretation centre.

Project design by Maverick ICS, post production by Kom Kom Doorn.

Client: the [Fundação Batalha de Aljubarrota](http://www.fundacao-aljubarrota.pt "Battle of Aljubarrota Interpretation Centre"), Portugal.
