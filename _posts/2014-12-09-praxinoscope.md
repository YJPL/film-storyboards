Studies and illustrations for a <a title="Praxinoscope" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxinoscope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">praxinoscope</a> featuring a 14th century Castilian knight charging on warhorse.

Inspired by Muybridge sequential photographs of a galloping horse from his famous <a title="Muybridge's Complete Human and Animal Locomotion: All 781 Plates from the 1887 Animal Locomotion: New Volume 3 (Reprint of original volumes 9-11) — Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/048623794X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=048623794X&linkCode=as2&tag=httpfilmstory-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Animal Locomotion</em></a> series (1887). I would recommend the book, still unmatched to this day as a reference for painters and animators interested in studying movement. This praxinoscope is part of a larger permanent historical exhibition designed for the <a title="Atoleiros 1884" href="http://j.mp/Atoleiros-1384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battle of Atoleiros Interpretation Centre</a>, in Fronteira, Portugal. The knight above is an example of the cavalry that took part in the Battle of Atoleiros in <span style="color: #252525;">April 1384, </span><span style="color: #252525;">between </span>Portuguese<span style="color: #252525;"> infantry and a </span>punitive expedition<span style="color: #252525;"> </span><span style="color: #252525;">sent by </span>John I of Castile.
