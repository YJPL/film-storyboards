## Incident of the 8th of January
After ten years, it was due to happen. There was an unfortunate turn of events, an [incident](https://news.gandi.net/fr/2020/01/incident-majeur-sur-notre-infrastructure-dhebergement-au-luxembourg/) with the web host, so this site was gone. For a moment it looked all right, but soon we learned that the data was lost. This is fine. Ten years is a long run for a website. For now I just want to keep an archive of the pages (it may as well be worth it for SEO alone), then forget about it, and relaunch the front page with an updated design and newer works.

## No more database, please
Database means maintenance, which is time-consuming. It also means data loss looming around the corner, backups notwithstanding.
With this in mind, rebuilding with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), that I have used for other [projects](https://alternatyves.com), seemed like a logical choice.
