_Simple two or three steps:_

## Overview in thumbnail sketches

The first phase is a collaborative process to visualize the screenplay sequence by sequence. We discuss the film script intent with the director, production, or art department. Usually meeting face to face is the most efficient way to do this, although email, phone or conference calls work too.

This results in rough thumbnail sketches of every key shot. The goal is to find the best angles for complex scenes and outline the composition of each shot. Drafting camera angles into tiny compositions during a live discussion allows for quick revisions. We can explore visual options in a language close to writing the first draft.

## Drawing the storyboard

In the second phase, I spend time on my own re-drawing every frame with an emphasis on clarity and legibility.

## Presentation layout

Last, if requested, I’ll put the boards into a single document in Adobe InDesign or Apple Keynote<sup><a id="fnr1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn1">¹</a></sup>. Deliverables: native files or pdf documents in print and screen resolution. Either standalone framed shots with blank space for notes or with the full script. Even if it remains a working document, good presentation matters. A crisp and clean layout helps you communicate better and will smooth meetings and pitches.

In some cases, I design illustrated presentations with pushed concept art. Mood-boards for sets, realistic illustrations, complete characters animation bible, etc.

**Editing before filming**

Storyboarding allows you to see the whole picture of a project at once. In Film, a medium where a team creates a single story working together, it’s a simple yet unique way to keep a global perspective. As a planning tool, a storyboard helps the production prepare and budget a sequence. But it is also a powerful writing tool. As a visual screenplay, it lets you see how a story works in images. It helps you organize and test its sequences, rhythm, and flow. Thus, editing before filming.
