_Simple two or three steps:_

## Overview in thumbnail sketches

The first phase is a collaborative process to visualize the screenplay sequence by sequence. We discuss the film script's intent with the director, production team, or art department. Although meeting face-to-face offers an unparalleled opportunity for dialogue, we can maintain strong collaboration through email, phone, and video conferencing.

This results in rough thumbnail sketches of every key shot. The goal is to find the best angles for complex scenes and outline the composition of each shot. Drafting camera angles into tiny compositions during a live discussion allows for quick revisions. We can explore visual options in a language close to writing the first draft of your screenplay.

## Drawing the storyboard

In the second phase, I spend time on my own re-drawing every frame with an emphasis on clarity and legibility.

## Presentation layout

Last, if requested, I’ll put the boards into a single document in Adobe InDesign, or Apple Keynote[^1]. Deliverables: native files or pdf documents in print and screen resolution. Either standalone framed shots with blank space for notes or with the full script. Even if it remains a working document, good presentation matters. A crisp and clean layout helps you communicate better and will smooth meetings and pitches.

In some cases, I design illustrated presentations with pushed concept art. Mood-boards for sets, realistic illustrations, complete characters animation bible, etc.

**Editing before filming**

Storyboarding enables you to see the whole picture of a project at once. In Film, a medium where a team creates a single story, a storyboard is a simple yet unique way to keep a global perspective. As a planning tool, a storyboard helps the production prepare and budget a sequence. Furthermore, it is also a powerful writing tool, as a visual screenplay to help you see how a story would work in images. It lets you organize and test its sequences, rhythm, and flow. Thus, *editing before filming*.
