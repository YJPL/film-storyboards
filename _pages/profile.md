## Crafting storyboards since 1999.

_**Film Storyboards**_ is a one person studio focusing on production design and [visual storytelling](https://film-storyboards.com/portfolio "Film Storyboards and Production Design Portfolio"). I draw for films, animation, and multimedia.

In addition to storyboarding, the practice also provides production companies with concept art and set design.

I design stories for feature films, action, [historical movies](https://film-storyboards.com/?s=historical "historical"), and advertising [TV commercials](/?s=tv+commercial "TV Commercials / Film Storyboards - Production Design"), along with visual development work for animation series, and cultural venues.

I drew action sequences featuring cavalry and warhorses. Among them, horse-related drawings to pitch, visualize and produce equine shows. For example, pre-production drawings made for the [Aljubarrota Battle reconstitution](/aljubarrota-battle/ "Aljubarrota Royal Battle").

I often work on non-conventional cross-media projects. For instance, museography, shows, concerts and spectacular events requiring several screens and complex scenography. Thus I have experience designing props and costumes for theatre as well as scenic elements used in large-scale shows.

## Illustration and design

[Film-Storyboards.com](/ "Crafting Storyboards") is an extension of my work as an illustrator—focusing on pre production and visual development.
